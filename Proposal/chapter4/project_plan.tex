\section{Milestones and Timeline}
Table \ref{table:Milestones} is the full outline and expected completion for each milestone. The idea is to ensure the surrounding testbed is functioning correctly before designing the processor itself.

\section{Project Risks}
This project is low-risk and does contain any ethical concerns as the project is focused on digital programming and interfacing. However, there are still risks which are outlined in table \ref{table:Project Risks}.

\begin{table}[hbt!]
    \centering
        \caption{Project Risks}\label{table:Project Risks}
        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ lllX }
            \hline
            \textit{Risk} & \textit{Likelihood} & \textit{Severity} & \textit{Mitigation \& Prevention} \\ 
            \hline
            Missing Milestones & Likely & Moderate & Perfectionism will be avoided as much as possible, completing milestones will be emphasised instead. There are also several weeks of time in semester 2 that can be extended into if needed. \\
            \hline
            Losing Work & Catastrophic & Unlikely & Every increment of progress will be committed to an online Git Repository, off-loading work from any local devices. \\
            \hline
            Hardware Damage & Moderate & Unlikely & Electrical connections to hardware such as the FPGA board will be scrutinised before powering on. As for workstations, work will always be committed online so no progress is lost. \\
            \hline
            Improper Licensing & Minor & Unlikely & Even though the majority of software that will be used is open-source, licenses will be checked if the use-case is permissible. If not, then alternatives can be sought. \\
            \hline
            Health Risks & Moderate & High & Breaks/pauses from working time will be allocated. As there will be a lot of sitting, an exercise routine will be maintained outside of working times. \\
            \hline
            Working Outside Scope & Unlikely & Moderate & The milestones and topic definition will be closely adhered to. In case there's any additions to the scope, it will always be consulted by the supervisor first. \\
            \hline
