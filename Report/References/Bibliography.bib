% ***************************************************
%This example bibliography provides examples of a few different types of references. 
%You should make your own .bib file. You can do this directly from Mendeley, or by exporting a reference of list in BibTex format from your Endnote library, or an online database, etc.

%IMPORTANT: If using Endnote to create your bibliography please ensure you have manually populated the LABEL field of all your references as this is the citation key. This is not done automatically by Endnote, and is required for citing references in LaTeX.

%If you want to make separate Bibliography for each Chapter then you can make separate .bib file for each individual Chapter and call them at the end of that Chapter.tex file.

TLS allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. This document updates RFCs 5705 and 6066, and obsoletes RFCs 5077, 5246, and 6961. This document also specifies new requirements for TLS 1.2 implementations.}
