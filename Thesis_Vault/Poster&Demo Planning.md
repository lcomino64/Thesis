Presentation walkthrough:
Project Goals and Aims:
- We are trying to speed-up an algorithm on an FPGA that is serialised. So parallelisation cannot be used.
- Explain briefly how AES works.
- The chosen algorithm to implement was AES-128-CBC, since the CBC variant is actually what gets used in practice.

Introduce Softcore Processors
Introduce Open source design process i.e. what is used instead of a typical Xilinx workflow.

Discuss VexRiscv then VexRiscvSMP
